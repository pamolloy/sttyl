NAME
	sttyl - stty lite

SYNOPSIS
	sttyl [setting <character>]

DESCRIPTION
	Print or change terminal characteristics. stty-lite will only
	function properly with the Bourne Shell. The Bash shell does not
	read certain settings.

	The FSF version of stty accepts control characters as two character
	strings. However, this version only accepts single characters, which
	requires the user to type Ctrl-V and then the special character.

	Multiple command line arguments are accepted. Unlike stty, sttyl
	does not accept non-option arguments. In that case the error message
	"invalid argument" is printed to stderr.

	Special characters:
		erase CHAR
			CHAR will erase the last character typed

		intr CHAR
			CHAR will send an interrupt signal

		kill CHAR
			CHAR will erase the current line

	Special settings:
		N
			set the intput and output speeds to N bauds

	Input settings:
		[-]icrnl
			translate carriage return to newline

	Output settings:
		[-]onlcr
			translate newline to arraige return-newline

		[-]olcuc
			translate lowercase characters to uppercase

	Local settings:
		[-]echo
			echo input characters

		[-]echoe
			same as [-]crterase: echo erase characters as backspace-
			space-backspace

		[-]icanon
			enable erase, kill, werase, and rprnt special characters

		[-]isig
			enable interrrupt, quit, and suspend special characters

EXAMPLES
	List ALL available tty settings
		stty-lite

	Enable a setting by adding it as an argument and disable it by
	prepending the argument with a dash.
		stty -echo olcuc

	Assign a character to a setting by adding the character after the
	setting name.
		stty erase ^X

BUGS
	If the user attempts to set a special character with more than one
	character sttyl will assign the first character of that series,
	rather than returning an `invalid integer argument' error.
